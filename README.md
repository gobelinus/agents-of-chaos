# ðŸŒ€ agents-of-chaos

Welcome to **agents-of-chaos** â€” a sandbox for experimenting with autonomous AI agents, chaotic task flows, and orchestrated decision-making using cutting-edge frameworks like [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI), [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), and more.

This repo is where agents are born, break things, learn, and occasionally get their act together.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

To build, break, and iterate on intelligent agents that can:
- Collaborate across tasks using CrewAI
- Perform structured reasoning via LangGraph
- Scrape, synthesize, and act on real-world data
- Interface with APIs, documents, and human feedback

This is **not production-grade** â€” this is chaos by design.
